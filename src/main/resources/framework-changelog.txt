v0.2.0 30/04/2010 second "foundations" release 
  * Improvements to the menu building subsystem:
    * MenuProviding plugins can now create items in the View menu, and also
      create their own custom menus.
    * Bug fixes & refactoring; more tests.
    * The menu building subsystem is now documented in the reference part of
      the user guide.
  * Removed type-unsafe access of 'attributes' from DatabaseDescriptor.
  * Reworked several sections and improved the outline of the user guide.
  * Added the DatabaseClosing facade to allow plugins to hook into database
    closing.
  * Documented the new database wizard facade, database creating facade,
    database opening facade, database closing facade, database migration facade
    in the user guide.
  * Changed the database opening facade to take the same database objects as
    other database-related facades. (DataSource and SimpleJdbcTemplate).
  * Removed product-specific wording from the File/New intro wizard page.
  * Upgrades of components:
    * Upgraded to v1.2.128 of the H2 embedded database. This is not the most
      recent version, but versions later than this remove support for the
      H2 data format MiniMiser uses. Subsequent releases will add migration
      support for the new format, but this was deemed too large a change
      for this iteration.
