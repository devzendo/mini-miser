MiniMiser - a simple personal finance manager program
-----------------------------------------------------
Current outstanding small tasks:

BUGS:
* BUG: Currency symbols don't render correctly on Windows

CURRENT OUTSTANDING BLOCKERS FOR RELEASE:
* add the tab pane container - responsibility is adding/removing cards for open/
  closed databases (upon calls from OpenDatabaseList listener), adding/removing
  tabs for open/closed views (upon calls form menu actionlisteners), switching
  current card to match the current database (upon calls from OpenDatabaseList
  listener), providing notification mechanism for open/close/switch tab
  
  ? much of this is replicated in the opendatabaselist
  ? perhaps the database descriptor could be made polymorphic (for close)
    and allow addition of other stuff, not just the database
    perhaps this mechanism could be generalised into a set of attributes and
    attribute handlers that are called on open/close/switch to manipulate the
    attributes, or add/remove them as necessary? e.g. have a tab pane attribute
    handler that detects a database open, creates the tab pane, registers it
    with the tab pane manager to get it added to the card layout, then stashes
    it in the database descriptor's tab-pane attribute?
  ? attribute handlers are bound to the open database list at instantiation
    time by spring
  ? or they could be maintained in a parallel class that monitors the
    odl via listeners, but can get the database descriptor in question, and
    attach attributes to it?
  ? could opening be achieved via this?
    
  * creates a card layout
  * creates a new card for each new database in the ODL
  * switches to the appropriate card on switch database
  * there is a tab enumeration for the possible view tabs
  * view menu shows views that are currently available
  * availability depends on
    * prefs flags (SQL view)
    * code been written and bound - like menu action listeners and the menu
      builder
  * tabs can be opened or closed. open from the view menu. close? checkboxes in
    view menu?
  * tabs are ordered in the jtabbedpane by their enumeration order
  * tabs can get their database from their base class, which gets it from the
    tab container (jtabbedpane holder) which gets it upon new database opening.
  * open/close/switch tab can be listened for - notifications include the
    database name and tab name
  * the currently open tabs for each database are persisted and restored
  * the currently selected tab for each database is persisted and restored
    
* need a message box with an option to never display this message again, with
  the flag to ignore this keyed message being stored in prefs.
* use this when the SQL view is first opened - this is a developer-only
  feature.
 

* prefs should be stored in platform-specific location, not just ~/.minimiser -
  need ~/Library/Application Support/MiniMiser on Mac OS X
  need Documents and Settings/username/whatever on Windows.

* add a prefs dialog
  * follow Apple HIG - no OK/Apply/Cancel lossage, just set the prefs you want
    and close the dialog. If you foul up, just change the settings back. Apply
    any changes on dialog close.
  * use a jtabbedpane with icons for the tabs
  * provide an advanced tab
  * have the 'SQL view available' checkbox on there
  * add ability for checkbox-style flags to be got/set easily in prefs

* if 'SQL view available' flag enabled, enable the SQL view
* if 'SQL view available' flag gets disabled in prefs, close any currently-
  open SQL views.

* decide which currencies to support
* add currency object, entries for all supported currencies
* display flags in pretty list in currency wizard page
* choose a sensible default-selected currency based on system locale


* review all TODOs
* review code complexity, coverage, etc.

* decide final product name
* create logo
* System menu on main window and popups needs logo, not standard Java one.
* rename product


DRY / TDD improvements:
* database switching via menu does not seem to have been done TDD - 
  addDatabaseSwitchObserver is only called from wireAdapters - add tests

* DRY: createDatabaseWithPluggableOpenBehaviour was duplicated to allow multiple
  databases - this generalisation could be applied to all users of this code,
  then the single db open could be removed. PersistenceUnittestCase
  
* close on startup - problem remorting - closeFailureShouldDisplayAnError
  
* tests for opening a database that had had the opening software termiated on
  it - what about lock files being present on startup?

NIGGLES:
* change the frame title / tab set depending on the selected database - when
  opening many databases on startup, the display "thrashes". It should not do
  this until the last active database is switched to.

DOCUMENTATION:
* fill in the rest of the acks in credits.html

* Add a FAQ to the help contents with notes from the docs page re moving /
  renaming databases.

* about dialog
  * switch to HTML version of GPL2 text - text/plain looks poor
  * upgrade to GPL3?

* docs to write:
  * technical doc:
    * database schema
    * database schema model with Jude, versioned as of 0.1
    * architecture
    * coding guidelines
    * how to contribute
  * user reference guide
  * getting started guide
  
* blog category
* intro articles

MAVEN / BUILD:
* sort out generation of the app name and version from the pom
* create Maven basic core release contents assembly/dependencies plugin
* create installer for windows
* create .deb package for Ubuntu
* create .app package for Mac OS X

OUTSTANDING QUERIES:
* Q: Why prompt for close confirmation if we have databases open, on exit?
  It's not as though you'd lose any data (it is all in a database, after all).

* sourceforge account? Don't forget Enrique's offer!
* trac - Enrique!
* upload v0.1 to sourceforge
* release!
