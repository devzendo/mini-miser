MiniMiser - a simple personal finance manager program
-----------------------------------------------------
Current outstanding small tasks:

BUGS:
* if you have a db open in the previous list, and open a second instance,
  you get a nasty 'open in another process' dialog.
* sometimes on startup the hourglass sticks - happened soon after adding
  tools->options dialog - have added stuck hourglass detector to CursorManager
  but haven't reproduced it since.

CURRENT TASKS:
* refactoring menuimpl and the menus - loading state from the rest of the
  objects (prefs, opentablist, opendatabaselist), rather than replicating it
  in menustate. had added a factory to stash menustate, but this can go when
  the access via the springloader to the rest of the system objects is
  complete.
* menu updating methods currently pass in state as the menu used to maintain
  its own state which duplicated state held elsewhere (opentablist, open
  databaselist). These methods still receive data from the menumediator
  listeners, but do nothing with it.  

CURRENT OUTSTANDING BLOCKERS FOR RELEASE:
  
* the tab pane set:
  * switch tab listener?  
  * persist current open tab list on exit
  * open/close/switch tab can be listened for - notifications include the
    database name and tab name
  * the currently open tabs for each database are persisted and restored
  * the currently selected tab for each database is persisted and restored

* sql tab:
  * command handlers need to have some tests around them

* temporarily remove currency panel on new database wizard    

* need a message box with an option to never display this message again, with
  the flag to ignore this keyed message being stored in prefs.
* use this when the SQL view is first opened - this is a developer-only
  feature.
* use this on first startup, as an introduction. 

* prefs should be stored in platform-specific location, not just ~/.minimiser -
  need ~/Library/Application Support/MiniMiser on Mac OS X
  need Documents and Settings/username/whatever on Windows.


* if 'SQL view available' flag gets disabled in prefs, close any currently-
  open SQL views (with a notification)

* how are tabs that are initially hidden set hidden in prefs? there needs to be
  a set of default prefs that are stored on prefs creation. perhaps a prefs
  initialiser object that gets triggered to populate initial prefs on creation.


CROSS-PLATFORM UI ISSUES:
* the background to the tabs is the same colour as the tabs, making the tabs
  hard to see (on windows).
  Ditto the tabs in the about box.
* Mac:
  * menu should be on the standard apple menu bar
  * title should be set properly
  * there are white patches on the dialogs


-- final tasks before release --
* review all TODOs
* review code complexity, coverage, etc.

* decide final product name
* create logo, draw nice icons
* rename product


DRY / TDD improvements:
* database switching via menu does not seem to have been done TDD - 
  addDatabaseSwitchObserver is only called from wireAdapters - add tests

* DRY: createDatabaseWithPluggableOpenBehaviour was duplicated to allow multiple
  databases - this generalisation could be applied to all users of this code,
  then the single db open could be removed. PersistenceUnittestCase
  
* close on startup - problem remorting - closeFailureShouldDisplayAnError
  
* tests for opening a database that had had the opening software termiated on
  it - what about lock files being present on startup?

* change to injecting the StubProblemReporter into all places that
  currently use the ProblemDialog.

* refactor menu/menumediator - far too many responsibilities and coupling
  
NIGGLES:
* change the frame title / tab set depending on the selected database - when
  opening many databases on startup, the display "thrashes". It should not do
  this until the last active database is switched to.

DOCUMENTATION:
* fill in the rest of the acks in credits.html

* Add a FAQ to the help contents with notes from the docs page re moving /
  renaming databases.

* about dialog
  * switch to HTML version of GPL2 text - text/plain looks poor
  * upgrade to GPL3?
  * choose licence compatible with all components

* docs to write:
  * technical doc:
    * database schema
    * database schema model with Jude, versioned as of 0.1
    * architecture
    * coding guidelines, test driven development, listen to checkstyle
    * how to contribute
    * environment setup - eclipse, etc
  * user reference guide
  * getting started guide
  
* blog category
* intro articles

MAVEN / BUILD:
* sort out generation of the app name and version from the pom
* create Maven basic core release contents assembly/dependencies plugin
* create installer for windows
* create .deb package for Ubuntu
* create .app package for Mac OS X

OUTSTANDING QUERIES:
* Q: Why prompt for close confirmation if we have databases open, on exit?
  It's not as though you'd lose any data (it is all in a database, after all).

* sourceforge account? Don't forget Enrique's offer!
* trac - Enrique!
* upload v0.1 to sourceforge
* release!
