MiniMiser - a simple personal finance manager program
-----------------------------------------------------
Current outstanding small tasks:

BUGS:
* BUG: Currency symbols don't render correctly on Windows

CURRENT OUTSTANDING BLOCKERS FOR RELEASE:
* change the frame title depending on the selected database

* add the tab pane container

* store the current tab in prefs


* prefs should be stored in platform-specific location, not just ~/.minimiser -
  need ~/Library/Application Support/MiniMiser on Mac OS X
  need Documents and Settings/username/whatever on Windows.

* add a prefs dialog
* add 'open files from last time on startup' flag, make startup opener honour it
* add debug flag

* if debug flag, add an SQL interface panel

* decide which currencies to support
* add currency object, entries for all supported currencies
* display flags in pretty list in currency wizard page
* choose a sensible default-selected currency based on system locale


* review all TODOs
* review code complexity, coverage, etc.

* decide final product name
* create logo
* System menu on main window and popups needs logo, not standard Java one.
* rename product


DRY / TDD improvements:
* database switching via menu does not seem to have been done TDD - 
  addDatabaseSwitchObserver is only called from wireAdapters - add tests

* DRY: createDatabaseWithPluggableOpenBehaviour was duplicated to allow multiple
  databases - this generalisation could be applied to all users of this code,
  then the single db open could be removed. PersistenceUnittestCase
  
* close on startup - problem remorting - closeFailureShouldDisplayAnError
  
* tests for opening a database that had had the opening software termiated on
  it - what about lock files being present on startup?

DOCUMENTATION:
* fill in the rest of the acks in credits.html

* Add a FAQ to the help contents with notes from the docs page re moving /
  renaming databases.

* about dialog
  * switch to HTML version of GPL2 text - text/plain looks poor
  * upgrade to GPL3?

* docs to write:
  * technical doc:
    * database schema
    * database schema model with Jude, versioned as of 0.1
    * architecture
    * coding guidelines
    * how to contribute
  * user reference guide
  * getting started guide
  
* blog category
* intro articles

MAVEN / BUILD:
* sort out generation of the app name and version from the pom
* create Maven basic core release contents assembly/dependencies plugin
* create installer for windows
* create .deb package for Ubuntu
* create .app package for Mac OS X

OUTSTANDING QUERIES:
* Q: Why prompt for close confirmation if we have databases open, on exit?
  It's not as though you'd lose any data (it is all in a database, after all).

* sourceforge account? Don't forget Enrique's offer!
* trac - Enrique!
* upload v0.1 to sourceforge
* release!
