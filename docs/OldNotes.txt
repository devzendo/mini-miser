OldNotes.txt
============

This is a collection of design sketches for various aspects of the system
as added to the ongoing TODO.txt, then moved here when complete.

How tabs are created
--------------------
* the tab pane set:
  * TabPageCreatingDatabaseEventListener - restores / creates tab set upon
    open.
  * Always uses a custom (non-EDT) thread.
  * Needs to find list of tabs to create.
  * Needs to use a factory to instantiate the list of tabs
  * Factory:
    * called on non-EDT, given the JTabbedPane
    * stash the current database descriptor in the DatabaseDescriptorFactory
      at the start of the instantiation
    * define interface for tabs that defines JPanel createComponents() method
    * foreach tab
      * load prototype tab bean, resolving dependencies, NOT on EDT
      * createComponents gets called to create panel on EDT, panel is added to
        the relevant tab on the tabbed pane (on the EDT)
    * remove current database descriptor from the DatabaseDescriptorFactory

How multiple databases are managed with a card layout
-----------------------------------------------------
* add the tab pane container - responsibility is adding/removing cards for open/
  closed databases (upon calls from an OpenDatabaseList listener), adding/removing
  tabs for open/closed views (upon calls from menu actionlisteners), switching
  current card to match the current database (upon calls from an OpenDatabaseList
  listener), providing notification mechanism for open/close/switch tab
  
  - create a springbeanlistloader that loads ODL listeners, before database
    opener/close lifecycle
  - instantiate tab pane manager to create the empty card layout panel, after
    the menu, before starting the lifecycles
  - create tabbedpane database event listener that adds jtabbedpanes to
    the dd.
  - add a database event listener that's bound to the ODL after the
    tabbedpane database event listener
    that is an adapter to the tabpanemanager - so that the tabpanemanager
    (which does not implement odl listener but has similar semantics for open/
    switch/close) can get the jtabbedpane out of the dd
    (ordering of these operations is sensitive) and set in the card layout.
    This adapter also enables switch and close behaviour to be handled directly
    by the tab pane manager.
    
  * creates a card layout
  * creates a new card for each new database in the ODL
  * switches to the appropriate card on switch database
  * there is a tab enumeration for the possible view tabs
  * view menu shows views that are currently available
  * availability depends on
    * prefs flags (SQL view)
    * code been written and bound - like menu action listeners and the menu
      builder
  * tabs can be opened or closed. open from the view menu. close? checkboxes in
    view menu?
  * tabs are ordered in the jtabbedpane by their enumeration order
  * tabs can get their database from their base class, which gets it from the
    tab container (jtabbedpane holder) which gets it upon new database opening.
  * open/close/switch tab can be listened for - notifications include the
    database name and tab name
  * the currently open tabs for each database are persisted and restored
  * the currently selected tab for each database is persisted and restored

Don't Display This Message Again Dialog
---------------------------------------
* need a message box with an option to never display this message again, with
  the flag to ignore this keyed message being stored in prefs.
  * some use cases:
    * fresh install / upgrades - want to display a welcome message on startup
      with option to turn off - key for this would relate to the version of
      the software. either upgrade or fresh install would have a fresh key,
      so you'd be prompted each time.
      - would want an option to view welcome message again (ignoring the 'don't
        show this message again' flag) via the help menu.
      - after many upgrades, the prefs will fill up with 'don't show this
        message again' flags, keyed on version numbers
      - store current software version in prefs:
        - if not present or different,
            show the message
            save current software version
          else (if same as last time)
            and static 'startup message' key not present,
              show the message
    * new version available
      - needs a 'show more detail' / 'what's new in this release option
      - the check for 'don't show this again' flag should be separate from the
        actual display (and in this case, the obtaining of the message(s) text).
        the actual display could be left to the message queue, see below.
      - in this case, 'don't show this again' flag must be cleared if upgraded 
        to, or past the version indicated (see above 'current software version'
        discussion).
  * message being displayed should be rich, not just plain text
  * there should be a facility to clear all such flags, so you do see the
    messages again. from the tools options dialog.
  * there's an abstract base class, stub for tests, and GUI impl for real - of
    a message displayer.
  
  * the 'software version has changed' detection code crops up again in the
    use cases below (message queue, software update available detector) - it
    should be extracted to the framework, with a series of configurable
    listeners
  * the 'broadcast messages' use case has another criteria for clearing the
    DSTA flag - should extract the  'DSTA clear condition evaluator' to an
    interface/pattern.
    
Message Queue
-------------
* messages popping up all over the place in dialogs are intensely distracting,
  and should only be used in urgent cases where ettiquete must be put aside
  temporarily by the importance of the message
* need an unobtrusive indicator - perhaps in the status bar - for indicating
  to the user that there are messages waiting.
* the indicator needs to gently remind the user that there are messages, but
  needs to be invisible when there are no messages - users don't tend to
  notice slight changes (greyed out to gently pulsing), but they'd notice
  not present to present-and-gently-pulsing.
* if the indicator is present, and has been pulsing for a while, it should get
  a little more insistent, but never pop up nag dialogs. GentleApps do not
  do this :-) It should never become annoying.
* the indicator should start indicating at the end of startup
* need to separate:
  - determining that a message should be queued (might need to use the 'don't
    show this message again' flags) - e.g. user has been told that vx.y.z is
    available once, via the message queue, and has elected not to see such
    messages again (for this new version?)
  - display of the message list, if more than one
  - display of the message body - there could be:
    - simple text informational messages
    - complex informational messages (e.g. HTML/images?).
    - messages could have some control UI - 
      e.g.
         1. 'a standing order (council tax) is overdue (was due on 07/11/2008)
             - add to your 'payments' account?' YES/NO
         2. 'update is available' SHOW CHANGES / SHOW COMPLETE CHANGES
    - DSTA messages (factor out the DSTA dialog's panel)
      (will there be a UI mismatch between the DSTA checkbox and the message
       queue UI? What happens to the message when the user says
       'Don't show this again'? How does the message disappear?)
    ... probably each message would just be displyed abstractly via a
        Component - if the message provider provides a control UI, then it's
        up to the provider to handle any logic necessary (e.g. a panel to
        show the DSTA messgae and checkbox, or holding complex
        schedule persistence logic, etc.)
        There could be 'standard' Components for displaying simple text
        and complex HTML/image message content.
* how are messages removed from the list once read? (see point about DSTA
  checkbox above)        
* message structure:
  - subject
  - importance
  - body
* typical messages:
  - an upgrade is available - see Software Update Available Notification below
  - schedule messages (see standing order example above)
  - assistance - 'did you know there's an easier way to enter split
    transactions?...' (debatable UI value - they annoy expert users "I see you
    are writing a letter!")
* should such messages be persistent? probably not, if they were urgent enough
  they'd be displayed immediately. non-urgent messages don't require a special
  persistence mechanism; they're not important enough.

Software Update Available Notification
--------------------------------------
* User needs to be asked whether software update checks are permissible. they
  should be disabled until the user indicates that they are.
* Need a dialog (a Message) asking them whether update checks should be made,
  with a short statement of what the communication to HQ involves, and a link
  to the privacy policy.
* Permission message to be posted on upgrade/startup unless consent has
  been given/denied. Consent via message control - a checkbox. 
* Privacy policy also needs to state that it is not mandatory for there to be
  a connection to the network in order for the software to work.
* Need a menu link to perform an update availability check. If used, the
  update checker should publish its progress via the progress reporter, and jump
  straight to the 'update is available / show changes / show complete changes'
  dialog (below)
* Need a privacy policy message dialog.  
* Need to schedule an update check shortly after each startup. If the update
  check is done automatically, it should be unobtrusive.
* Does a HTTP connection to my server
* Two possible queries:
  - get current version number
  - get change log
* Change log is in specific format, but pretty loose:
  x.y.z
  -----
  lots of text
  more text
  (blank lines)
  * could have
  * bullet lists
  could possibly use some small form of _markup_ !
* Should be readable as ASCII, but translatable into HTML for rich display
* Need a dialog that notifies the user that there is a new version (x.y.z)
  available, using the 'don't show this again' mechanism, above.
* This dialog needs a 'what's new in this release' button that shows only the
  sections of release notes that reflect the changes between your current
  version, and the latest version  .
* The dialog should have a 'show complete change log' button.
* The change log should be cached in the ~/.minimiser directory and this
  gets flushed when the current software version changes (see the discussion of
  version number changing in the 'don't show this again' section, above. i.e.
  configurable listeners)
* This subsystem does NOT do the update - there is no automatic download
  facility - the user must download it and install it themselves.

* more design notes on software updates:
  * on upgrade/install post the update check requested message if check
    allowed flag not set in prefs.
  * this might set the check allowed boolean flag in prefs
  * on prefs change - specifically the update check going true - trigger the
    daily update check with a progress-bar updating adapter.
  * on explictly selecting check for updates from the help menu, trigger the
    daily update check with a progress bar updating adapter, ignoring whether
    any update checks have occurred today (you can always force an update check)
    - perhaps this could be done by clearing the last-update-check day prefs
    setting
  * check for updates must be greyed out unless prefs allow
  * add a task to the startup queue that repeatedly waits for an hour, then
    triggers the daily update check with no adapter (there will be no UI during
    background update checks)
    
  * the actual update check:
    * do nothing (warn) if prefs deny the check - shouldn't get here if prefs
      do not allow it
    * do nothing if today == the date-of-last-update-check in prefs
    * try to do the update check:
      * get the latest (remote) version number
      * if successful:
        * if no remote version stored in prefs or if remote version is different
            to current runtime version
          * get the change log and cache
          * if change log downloaded ok:
            * set date-of-last-update-check to today
            * store the remote version number in prefs
            * post message informing user of details of new update
          
Version comparison
------------------
* Need to be able to compare versions to find out if there's an update,
  given current version and latest version. Need to cope with current being
  2.3.1 and a patch release of 2.3.1.1, or an update of 2.3.2 or 2.4, or 2.4.0
  or 2.4.3, or 3.
* Classifiers should not be ignored in the version comparison, so current 2.3.1
  and 2.4.0-RC1 should be the same update-availablity as 2.4.0 (yes, there's
  an update). But current 2.4.0-RC1 to 2.4.0 should be an update.
    
Broadcast Messages
------------------
# I've decided against implementing this - can do all I need with the software
  update available notification. (at least, for now).
* Additional query on server:
  - get current message text
* Might be a need for a way to broadcast a message to all users - via a file
  placed on the server. This would be checked during update checking, and if
  changed, prompted for display with a 'don't show this again' flag, which is
  cleared when the message changes.
* 'clear DSTA flag when the message changes' - extract this to a pattern of
  'DSTA clear condition evaluator'
* Don't show any message if there is no message on the server
x overengineering.......
* Messages may need to be keyed
* Message files may need to be related to a particular version of the software
  or global
* Cache the message file
* How do we know when to clear out the server message file? When everyone's
  read it? (how do we know that?)
* Is this really needed? Can't it be covered by the software update / change
  log? If there's a reason to communicate with the users, it'll be because
  there's new functionality, or, horrors, a bug that can't wait 'til the next
  release (so we'd branch, and produce a patch release)
