============

This is a collection of old design sketches for various aspects of the system
as added to the ongoing TODO.txt, then moved here when complete.

How tabs are created
--------------------
* the tab pane set:
  * TabPageCreatingDatabaseEventListener - restores / creates tab set upon
    open.
  * Always uses a custom (non-EDT) thread.
  * Needs to find list of tabs to create.
  * Needs to use a factory to instantiate the list of tabs
  * Factory:
    * called on non-EDT, given the JTabbedPane
    * stash the current database descriptor in the DatabaseDescriptorFactory
      at the start of the instantiation
    * define interface for tabs that defines JPanel createComponents() method
    * foreach tab
      * load prototype tab bean, resolving dependencies, NOT on EDT
      * createComponents gets called to create panel on EDT, panel is added to
        the relevant tab on the tabbed pane (on the EDT)
    * remove current database descriptor from the DatabaseDescriptorFactory

How multiple databases are managed with a card layout
-----------------------------------------------------
* add the tab pane container - responsibility is adding/removing cards for open/
  closed databases (upon calls from an OpenDatabaseList listener), adding/removing
  tabs for open/closed views (upon calls from menu actionlisteners), switching
  current card to match the current database (upon calls from an OpenDatabaseList
  listener), providing notification mechanism for open/close/switch tab
  
  - create a springbeanlistloader that loads ODL listeners, before database
    opener/close lifecycle
  - instantiate tab pane manager to create the empty card layout panel, after
    the menu, before starting the lifecycles
  - create tabbedpane database event listener that adds jtabbedpanes to
    the dd.
  - add a database event listener that's bound to the ODL after the
    tabbedpane database event listener
    that is an adapter to the tabpanemanager - so that the tabpanemanager
    (which does not implement odl listener but has similar semantics for open/
    switch/close) can get the jtabbedpane out of the dd
    (ordering of these operations is sensitive) and set in the card layout.
    This adapter also enables switch and close behaviour to be handled directly
    by the tab pane manager.
    
  * creates a card layout
  * creates a new card for each new database in the ODL
  * switches to the appropriate card on switch database
  * there is a tab enumeration for the possible view tabs
  * view menu shows views that are currently available
  * availability depends on
    * prefs flags (SQL view)
    * code been written and bound - like menu action listeners and the menu
      builder
  * tabs can be opened or closed. open from the view menu. close? checkboxes in
    view menu?
  * tabs are ordered in the jtabbedpane by their enumeration order
  * tabs can get their database from their base class, which gets it from the
    tab container (jtabbedpane holder) which gets it upon new database opening.
  * open/close/switch tab can be listened for - notifications include the
    database name and tab name
  * the currently open tabs for each database are persisted and restored
  * the currently selected tab for each database is persisted and restored
