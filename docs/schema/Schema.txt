Schema.txt - About the MiniMiser database schema
------------------------------------------------

The schema is versioned, such that subsequent revisions of the application will
be able to upgrade old databases to match what they're expecting to deal with.

It won't be possible to run the app against old format databases without
upgrading.

There is always a Versions table, which holds versioning information for all
necessary items. The list of items that are versionable and would have their
version numbers stored in the Versions table can be found in the
VersionableEntity class.

The current database schema as understood by this verision of the app can be
found in the CurrentSchemaVersion class.

Each version of the schema is described below, also see the diagrams in the
Schema.vX.{jude|png} files. These are produced using Change-Vision's excellent
JUDE UML modelling tool (Community Edition), and exported to PNG for those who
don't use this tool.
